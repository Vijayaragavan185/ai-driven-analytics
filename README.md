# AI-Driven Data Analytics for Automated Business Insights

This project implements an advanced, AI-driven data analytics system that automatically processes business data, generates predictions, visualizes insights, and produces natural language reports with actionable recommendations.

## Project Objectives

- Develop automated data processing pipelines for business data
- Implement machine learning models for prediction and pattern discovery
- Create interactive visualization dashboards for real-time insights
- Generate automated natural language reports with key business findings
- Detect anomalies and unusual patterns in business metrics
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis

## Features

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Automated cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- **Predictive Modeling**: Multiple regression algorithms with model selection and evaluation
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of business metrics and predictions
- **Automated Insights**: Natural language reports highlighting key trends and anomalies
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical and machine learning-based outlier identification
- **Business Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions for performance improvement

## Usage Guide

### Data Processing

Process raw business data with the preprocessing module:

python -m src.data_processing.preprocessing


The system will compare multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) and select the best model based on performance metrics.

### Interactive Dashboard

Launch the interactive web dashboard:

python -m src.run_dashboard


Then open http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser.

Dashboard features:
- Visualize business metrics over time
- Filter data by date ranges
- Explore correlations between metrics
- View model predictions and feature importance
- Monitor key performance indicators
- Detect unusual patterns or outliers

### Automated Business Insights

Generate natural language reports with business insights:

python -m src.run_insights


Options:
- `--data`: Specify custom data file path
- `--metrics`: Comma-separated list of metrics to analyze
- `--report-type`: Generate 'detailed' or 'executive' reports (default: detailed)

Example:
python -m src.run_insights --metrics sales,marketing_spend,customer_count --report-type executive


The system will:
- Analyze trends and patterns in business data
- Detect anomalies and unusual behavior
- Identify correlations between metrics
- Generate natural language reports with actionable recommendations

Reports are saved as Markdown files in the `reports/` directory.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branches**

git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name


2. **Run tests before committing**

Run specific tests
python -m unittest tests/test_module.py

Run all tests
python -m unittest discover



## Future Enhancements

- Deep learning models for more complex pattern recognition
- Natural language query interface for business questions
- Real-time data streaming integration
- Automated alert system for critical metric changes
- Integration with business intelligence tools
